# Credit Risk Modeling Project

## Credit Scoring Overview

### 1. Basel II Accord and Model Clarity
The Basel II Accord is built on three pillars: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review, and market discipline. For our model:
- **Compliance Needs**: Banks must prove their risk systems are sound and validated, requiring a model where decisions are transparent for regulators.
- **Documentation Requirements**: Detailed records of the modeling process, including feature choices, proxy variable creation, and validation steps, are critical.
- **Risk Calibration**: The model must effectively distinguish risk levels to support accurate capital allocation based on risk weights.

### 2. Proxy Variables: Purpose and Risks
Lacking direct default data:
- **Role**: A proxy using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics can estimate credit risk by linking transactional patterns to repayment likelihood.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Misclassification Errors**: The proxy may mislabel customers, leading to lost revenue (false positives) or increased defaults (false negatives).
  - **Behavioral Misalignment**: E-commerce transaction patterns may not fully reflect credit repayment behavior.
  - **Regulatory Oversight**: The proxy methodology must be clearly justified to meet compliance expectations.

### 3. Model Complexity Considerations
**Simple Models (e.g., Logistic Regression with WoE)**:
- *Advantages*: Clear interpretability, compliance with "right to explanation" rules, and easier validation and auditing.
- *Disadvantages*: May fail to capture complex nonlinear relationships, potentially limiting predictive accuracy.

**Complex Models (e.g., Gradient Boosting)**:
- *Advantages*: Superior predictive performance and ability to model intricate feature interactions.
- *Disadvantages*: Lack of transparency creates regulatory hurdles and challenges in explaining decisions to customers.

**Recommended Approach**: Start with interpretable models, adopting more complex models only if performance gains outweigh regulatory and compliance challenges.
